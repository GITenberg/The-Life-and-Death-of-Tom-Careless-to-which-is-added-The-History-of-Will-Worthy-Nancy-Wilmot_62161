CARELESS,</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Good</span> people all I
pray give ear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the tale I tell;<br />
&rsquo;Tis form&rsquo;d to gratify your mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to instruct you well.</p>
<p class="poetry">To caution men of riper years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to admonish youth;<br />
Fiction may fill th&rsquo; improving page,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And use the voice of truth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Tom Careless was a merry lad;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (And who will mirth despise?)<br />
But he like many other wits,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More merry was than wise.</p>
<p class="poetry">Tom was a working carpenter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet while he plied his trade,<br />
His tongue mov&rsquo;d faster than his hands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And less was done than said.</p>
<p class="poetry">He told his tale, he crack&rsquo;d his joke,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a perfect droll;<br />
And of each jovial drinking set,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was both the life and soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">On such a character as this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some did with envy gaze;<br />
While others wiser, saw much more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To pity than to praise.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>For Tom with all his merriment,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That made such mighty rout,<br />
Had taken vice and folly in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And quite shut wisdom out.</p>
<p class="poetry">He neither look&rsquo;d, nor car&rsquo;d,
beyond<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The present passing hour!<br />
Alas! now see his sky o&rsquo;ercast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And storms begin to lour.</p>
<p class="poetry">A burning fever seiz&rsquo;d his frame!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look how he pants for breath;<br />
And in his vitals feels transfixt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Th&rsquo; envenomed dart of death.</p>
<p class="poetry">He feels and shudders at the stroke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He turns but keeps his pain;<br />
He looks with eager eyes for help,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But human help is vain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now conscience from her slumber wakes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with a dismal cry,<br />
Proclaims the vices of his life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And summons him to die.</p>
<p class="poetry">To die! to leave the present world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To yield his vital breath!<br />
To close his eyes on life, and tread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark, dark vale of death!</p>
<p class="poetry">To see th&rsquo; uplifted stroke that must<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; His soul and body sever!<br />
And then to lose the light of life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever and for ever!</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twas more than human strength could
bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The agonizing strife,<br />
Sunk his distracted spirits down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Close to the verge of life.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Then his fellow-workmen came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Careless to condole;<br />
Who talk&rsquo;d of former scenes of mirth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To cheer his troubl&rsquo;d soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">But, ah! when conscience sorely
smarts&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose spirit can endure?<br />
When <span class="smcap">God</span> inflicts the mighty
wound&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What mortal hand can cure?</p>
<p class="poetry">Outstretch&rsquo;d, his flesh all trembling
lies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He heaves a mournful sigh;<br />
Attempts to raise his aching head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ope&rsquo; his languid eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">On the companions of his life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He casts a dismal look;<br />
And, lab&rsquo;ring with conflicting thoughts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the sad silence broke:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Ah! ye do well to see a wretch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose peace and health are fled;<br />
Ye knew him once in festive scenes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now on his dying bed.</p>
<p class="poetry">But, O, for ever from my mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hide ev&rsquo;ry guilty joy;<br />
Oor they&rsquo;ve polluted all my life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And will my soul destroy.</p>
<p class="poetry">In sickness, pain, decay, and death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What agonies ye bring!<br />
All pointed with the envenom&rsquo;d barb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of sin&rsquo;s eternal sting.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;But have ye no sweet hope to give?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No comfort to supply?<br />
Must I still languish and despair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then&mdash;ah! must I die?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>How can my naked spirit stand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before a righteous <span
class="smcap">God</span>?<br />
Who, who, shall hide me from his eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or shield me from his rod?</p>
<p class="poetry">O what a load of guilt I feel!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My anguish who can tell?<br />
My sins will shut me out of heav&rsquo;n,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sink me down to hell.</p>
<p class="poetry">By all the mis&rsquo;ries which I feel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By all the wrath I dread;<br />
By heav&rsquo;ns just veng&rsquo;ance soon to fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On my devoted head;</p>
<p class="poetry">I charge you to forsake your sins,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>
fly:<br />
O may he bless you while you live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And save you when you die.</p>
<p class="poetry">But as for me, can mercy come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Call&rsquo;d for with parting
breath?&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
He said&mdash;and straight his quiv&rsquo;ring lips,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever clos&rsquo;d in death!</p>
<h2><span class="GutSmall">THE</span><br />
<i>History of Will Worthy and Nancy Wilmot</i>.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> vain the living
soul may strive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For happiness below;<br />
This world no solid joy can give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor lasting peace bestow.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Will Worthy</i> was a sprightly lad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As ever trod the mead;<br />
He thought no cares could make him sad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While pleasure took the lead.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Dex&rsquo;trous at all the rustic games,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He oft his strength display&rsquo;d,<br />
Now the swift race his breast inflames,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By emulation sway&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="poetry">At every country fair and wake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Will</i> was the wonder there:<br />
Fair females crowded for his sake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And strove his smiles to share.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet Nancy Wilmot of the vale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Won <i>William&rsquo;s</i> roving heart;<br />
To her he told love&rsquo;s tender tale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now nothing could them part.</p>
<p class="poetry">To church they went, the knot was tied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The day was spent in glee;<br />
Inviting all to them allied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To join their jollity.</p>
<p class="poetry">The self-same eve, when on the green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Will</i> danc&rsquo;d with Nance his bride;<br />
Lo! what a sad reverse of scene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She fainted&mdash;droop&rsquo;d&mdash;and
died!!!</p>
<p class="poetry">Dismay and horror seiz&rsquo;d each soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When this sad news was known,<br />
For her the passing-bell did toll,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Eternity</span> her home.</p>
<p class="poetry">Like the weak grass, or tender flow&rsquo;r,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or vapour&rsquo;s empty breath;<br />
Sweet Nancy wither&rsquo;d in an hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut down by sudden death.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>William</i> bewail&rsquo;d her early
fate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A prey to woe and grief;<br />
Pensive, forlorn, and wan he sat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And would have no relief.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>The question &ldquo;if her soul was safe?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gave poignancy to woe;<br />
Should hell have follow&rsquo;d sudden death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Would she not thither go?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">From brooding on <i>her</i> doubtful lot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now fix&rsquo;d for ever sure;<br />
His mind now turn&rsquo;d its every thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To <i>his</i> sick soul and cure.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;How shall I flee from wrath to come,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where hide my guilty head?<br />
Should I next go to my long home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where shall I be?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="poetry">He bade adieu to sinful joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And trac&rsquo;d the moral page;<br />
The fine clad sentiment could cloy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But not his grief assuage.</p>
<p class="poetry">No, he had tried all these in vain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All &ldquo;empty, void, and waste;&rdquo;<br />
They serv&rsquo;d but to increase his pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Involving ruin fast.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus, baffled, wearied, and
distress&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He did a Bible see;<br />
There found a prayer for one oppress&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, undertake
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">To church on Sundays he had been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As others come and go;<br />
But ne&rsquo;er by faith had <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or heard what <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
could do.</p>
<p class="poetry">Until, with circumcised ear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He when at church one day,<br />
Found mercy to his soul draw near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which to <i>his</i> heart did say:</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Come unto me, thou weary soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Laden with num&rsquo;rous sins;<br />
No case so bad that can controul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My grace where it begins.</p>
<p class="poetry">Why so disquieted art thou,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sins, and fears, and care?<br />
Lo th&rsquo; accepted time is now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tho&rsquo; lost, do not despair.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lost in yourself, in <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> there&rsquo;s hope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And never till you&rsquo;re lost,<br />
Relinquish ev&rsquo;ry other prop,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then you&rsquo;ll prize him most.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twas such he came to seek and save,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And could he come in vain?<br />
And if no other hope you have,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You need no more complain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The sermon ended, <i>Will</i> went home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stepp&rsquo;d up and lock&rsquo;d his door;<br />
Fell on his knees before <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
throne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mercy did implore.</p>
<p class="poetry">Mercy he found, and after liv&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Daily <i>on</i> <span class="smcap">Christ</span> by
faith;<br />
<i>To</i> Jesus liv&rsquo;d while he surviv&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Triumphant was in death.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
